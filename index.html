Have you always wanted LONGER FULLER THICKER eyelashes but were never able to achieve this with normal mascara? Eyelash Solutions' Semi-Permanent Eyelash Extensions are the answer!
<br />
The newest cosmetic trend that is becoming the most popular way of creating longer, thicker and more dramatic lashes.
<br />
Each fake eyelash is meticulously applied, one at a time, to your own natural lashes. They last up to six weeks, are 100% waterproof and comfortable to wear.
<br />
These elite, innovative lash extensions can increase and transform your limp, lack-lustre, short, thin eyelashes by 200%.
<br />
You can happily leave your eyelash curlers on the side because, unlike other lashes on the market, they are pre-curled to give the eye a more open and youthful appearance.
<br />
The technique isolates one lash at a time, working individually on every row of lashes, to ensure a natural and beautiful extension to your existing lashes. The results speak for themselves, Eyelash Solutions extensions are the softest and most comfortable to wear, and provide excellent staying power.</p>
<p class="text">
Eyelash Solutions extensions will last for the full life cycle of a natural lash, providing the aftercare is followed. The average eyelash cycle is 60 days, which is the amount of time it takes for a natural lash to grow in, and fall out. Eyelash extensions can be worn on a permanent basis, we recommend touch-up appointments every two to four weeks, to fill in the areas where the natural lashes have fallen out and new lashes are growing in.
  
</p>
<p class="text">
An instant transformation from ordinary to extraordinary, eliminating the need for mascara, taking years off the appearance of tired eyes and ensuring you look pretty from the moment you wake up.

<h2>Procedure</h2>
<p class="text">
After the initial consultation to establish what type of look you are going for, it''s time to relax and lay down on the couch.
<br />
We will clean the lashes to ensure the lash extensions bond correctly to the host lash.We will then place small white pads under each eye which are placed over the lower lashes to keep them out of the way. Your eyes are then kept closed for the duration of the procedure.Using tweezers we will separate the individual lash that is going to receive the extension. The extension lash is then placed on to the host lash with a formulated bonding agent.The application takes approximately 2 hours and voila! Beautiful new lashes! <br> <a href="#!/page_MORE" class="button1">read more</a> </div> <div class="col2 pad_left6"> <div class="scroll-pane"><div> <h2>Preparation for your Appointment</h2> <img src="images/news03.jpg" alt="" class="left border1 radius1 img2"> <div class="table"> <h5>Please allow 2 hours for your first treatment to complete your eyelash extension consultation and glue sensitivity test.</h5> <h3> Do not wear any eye make-up or mascara. </h3> <p class="text"> The extensions must be applied on clean, dry eyelashes.Any moisturizer or mascara might react with the glue ingredients.</p> <h3>Do not wear contact lenses or use eyelash curlers on the day of treatment.</h3><p class="text">The applications procedure involves sticking the extensions to your natural lashes, so in the unlikely event that any glue gets into your eyes, you will need to wash it out quickly, and the contact lenses would only be in your way. You can wear your contact lenses again as soon as the treatment is finished.</p><h3>Do not tint or perm your eyelashes.</h3> Eyelash extensions cannot be applied for at least 48 hours after these treatments. </div> <div class="clear"></div> <div class="line1"></div> <h2>Aftercare for Lash Extensions</h2><h4> To get the most out of your eyelash solutions, you need to follow some simple instructions:</h4> <img src="images/news04.jpg" alt="" class="left border1 radius1 img2">
<div class="table">
<h3>No water should contact eyelashes for 24 hours.</h3>
For 48 hours after treatment do not steam face, use steam bath, swim or wash face with hot water.
<br />
Only use water based mascara on the tips of your lashes, although, you dont need it and it can shorten the life of the extensions.
<br />
If you wear mascara on your bottom lashes make sure that it is water based.
<br />
If you wear eye liner the best ones to use are the felt tip pens or gel, avoid pencil eye liners as they tend to be oily and can clog between the lashes.
<br />
<h3>Do not use an eyelash curler or perm the lashes.</h3>
It will break the eye lashes and/or crease them.However, you can use the heated eyelash curlers which are particularly good for the real mink eyelash extensions and are available from us.
<br />
<h3>Do not rub lashes when washing your face.</h3>
Always pat dry after cleansing.
<br />
<h3>Do not pull on eyelashes.</h3>
The bond on the extensions is so strong that it will pull your own eyelash out along with the new ones.
<br />
If you wear eye makeup, a powder based eye shadow is best.
<br />
To remove makeup use an oil free make-up remover avoiding touching the eyelashes.
<br />
Emollients, creams, and oils are the eyelash bonding agents worst enemy. Use eye creams sparingly and avoid lid/lash area.
<br />
We naturally lose a couple of lashes a day which we seldom notice, however, you will notice with the extensions and if you see your lash attached to the extensions dont panic, :) thats exactly what is supposed to happen! <3

<h2>Overview</h2>
<div class="scroll-pane"><div>
<h4> How Are Eyelash Extensions Done? </h4>
<img src="images/services01.jpg" alt="" class="left border1 radius1 img2">
<div class="table">
<p class="text">
There will be a consultation before we start to establish what look you are after, I will then recommend the best length and curl of false lashes to suit your needs and based on the condition of your own lashes, but ultimately the choice is yours. The initial application of the semi permanent eyelash extensions will take approximately 2 hours. Once we start the application all you need to do is relax and keep your eyes closed. It's totally painless. When you open your eyes, you will have thick and beautiful lashes.
  
</p>
</div>
<div class="clear"></div>
<div class="line1"></div>
<h4>
How Many Eyelash Extensions Are Applied?
</h4>
<img src="images/services02.jpg" alt="" class="left border1 radius1 img2">
<div class="table">
<p class="text">
Anywhere between 50 to 150 individual false eyelashes are applied per eye, the final amount will be dependent upon the size and shape of your eyes and type of look you want to achieve (natural or glamorous). I focus on designing and shaping the entire lash line using different lash sizes to create an individually designed look.
  
</p>
</div>
<div class="clear"></div>
<div class="line1"></div>
<h4>
How Long Will The Eyelash Extensions Last?
</h4>
<img src="images/services03.jpg" alt="" class="left border1 radius1 img2">
<div class="table">
<p class="text">
It is normal to lose a few false eyelashes in the first 24 hours whilst the adhesive is setting and care should be taken in this period. Your own lashes shed naturally and new ones continue to grow in a replenishing cycle. We naturally shed 2 to 4 lashes from each eye in a day. The semi permanent eyelash extensions will last as long as the cycle of your natural lash. Touch ups are recommended, every 3 to 4 weeks depending on your individual needs (you must still have over 50% of your false eyelashes remaining for it to be counted as a touch up). Your after care will affect how long your false eyelashes last.
  
</p>
</div>
<div class="clear"></div>
<div class="line1"></div>
<h4>
Can I Still Wear Make-Up?
</h4>
<img src="images/services05.jpg" alt="" class="left border1 radius1 img2">
<div class="table">
<p class="text">
Yes, you can continue to wear makeup when you wear semi permanent eyelash extensions but it is important to use an oil free makeup remover (oil will damage the bonding agent). You will find you no longer need to use mascara, however, you can still wear mascara on the tips of the lashes but waterproof mascara is not recommended. We also carry a range of aftercare products specifically made.
  
</p>
</div>
<div class="clear"></div>
<div class="line1"></div>
<h4>
Can I Shower And Swim While Wearing Eyelash Extensions?
</h4>
<img src="images/services04.jpg" alt="" class="left border1 radius1 img2">
<div class="table">
<p class="text">
You should avoid direct contact with water for the first 24 hours around the eye area but after that time they will be fine in water as the bonding agent is waterproof. If possible avoid direct contact with the jets of the shower on the semi permanent eyelash extensions and wear goggles when swimming.</div>

                    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
                    <h4>How Are Eyelash Extensions Done?</h4>
                    There will be a consultation before we start to establish what look you are after, I will then recommend the best length and curl of false lashes to suit your needs and based on the condition of your own lashes, but ultimately the choice is yours. The initial application of the semi permanent eyelash extensions will take approximately 2 hours. Once we start the application all you need to do is relax and keep your eyes closed. It's totally painless. When you open your eyes, you will have thick and beautiful lashes.
                    <br />
                    <h4>How Many Eyelash Extensions Are Applied?</h4>
                    Anywhere between 50 to 150 individual false eyelashes are applied per eye, the final amount will be dependent upon the size and shape of your eyes and type of look you want to achieve (natural or glamorous). I focus on designing and shaping the entire lash line using different lash sizes to create an individually designed look.
                    <br />
                    <h4>How Long Will The Eyelash Extensions Last?</h4>
                    It is normal to lose a few false eyelashes in the first 24 hours whilst the adhesive is setting and care should be taken in this period. Your own lashes shed naturally and new ones continue to grow in a replenishing cycle. We naturally shed 2/4 lashes from each eye in a day. The semi permanent eyelash extensions will last as long as the cycle of your natural lash. Touch ups are recommended, every 3/4 weeks depending on your individual needs (you must still have over 50% of your false eyelashes remaining for it to be counted as a touch up). Your after care will affect how long your false eyelashes last.
                    <br />
                    <h4>Can I Still Wear Make Up?</h4>
                    Yes, you can continue to wear make up when you wear semi permanent eyelash extensions but it is important to use an oil free make-up remover (oil will damage the bonding agent). You will find you no longer need to use mascara, however, you can still wear mascara on the tips of the lashes but waterproof mascara is not recommended. I also carry a range of after care products specifically made for false eyelashes.
                    <br />
                    <h4>Can I Shower And Swim While Wearing Eyelash Extensions?</h4>
                    You should avoid direct contact with water for the first 24 hours around the eye area but after that time they will be fine in water as the bonding agent is waterproof. If possible avoid direct contact with the jets of the shower on the semi permanent eyelash extensions and wear goggles when swimming.
